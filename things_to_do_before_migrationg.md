# Actions to be taken before migration

Please install Akeeba Backup, which is one of the best backup apps available for Joomla (and it is free! ) and take a **FULL BACKUP** of your site.

### Warning
If you proceed without taking a BACKUP and if you wanted to revert back to old version, you will end up going in the toughest route. So please take a FULL BACKUP of your site before proceeding with the migration

- Set your site offline
- Set Error Reporting to None in the Global Configuration
