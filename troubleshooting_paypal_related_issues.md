# Troubleshooting Paypal Related Issues

There could be several reasons why your Paypal Plugin is not working. This guide lists most common reasons and solutions for them.

### 1. Order status Failed

Are you using your Primary Paypal Email as your merchant email? If your order status is failed, then chances are that you are using a secondary email of your Paypal account.

Paypal allows you to add multiple emails in an account to accept payments. With the Paypal plugin for J2Store, make sure you are using your primary Paypal account email. You can check which is your primary email by signing into your Paypal account and then going to Profile -> Add / Edit emails page.
