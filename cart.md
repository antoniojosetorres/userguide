# Cart

This tab is dealing with the cart options.

* Add to Cart Placement

    This option is for placing the **add to cart** button. Three options are available to choose.
    1. Default Position
    
        If this option is selected, the add to cart button will be shown at the bottom of the page.
    2. Within Article using Tag
    
        A tag can be added with article id (e.g., j2storecart 5) inside the text in a desired location, and j2store will place the **add to cart** button in that location.
    3. Both
    
        Selecting this option will display the **add to cart** both at the bottom and also parse the tag, provided one(e.g., j2storecart 5) is added in the article text.
        
* Add to cart action

    This option helps the customer to decide on what has to be done when the **add to cart** button is clicked. Two options has been provided.
    
    1. Stay in the same page and show an inline link to a predefined location
    
    2. Redirect to default view of the cart
