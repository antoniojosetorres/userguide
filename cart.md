This tab is dealing with the cart options.

* Add to Cart Placement

    This option is for placing the **add to cart** button. Three options are available to choose.
    1. ***Default Position***
    
        If this option is selected, the add to cart button will be shown at the bottom of the page.
    2. ***Within Article using Tag***
    
        A tag can be added with article id (e.g., **{j2storecart 5}**) inside the text in a desired location, and j2store will place the **add to cart** button in that location.
    3. ***Both***
    
        Selecting this option will display the **add to cart** both at the bottom and also parse the tag, provided one(e.g., **j2storecart 5**) is added in the article text.
