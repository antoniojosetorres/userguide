# Weight based per item

In this type of shipping method, the shipping cost calculation based on the weight of every item that is added to the cart.
For e.g., if the cost is fixed at $ 10.00 up to 100 Kg for an item, and for every 10 Kg there after, an additional $ 2.00 will be charged. So, if an item weighs 200 kg, then the shipping cost for that item will be upto 100 kg = $ 10.00 and after that $ 2.00 for every 10 kg, so, for the next 100 kg, $ 2.00 X 10 = $ 20.00. And $ 10.00 + $ 20.00 = $ 30.00 will be the shipping cost for that item.
