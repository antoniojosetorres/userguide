# Downloadable Product

This type of products are downloaded from internet immediately after payment is processed.

The options in this type are almost identical to simple product except a very few.

Since this is downloadable, obviously it has no shipping option. Likewise, there is no options page also, to choose a color or size, because it has no physical existence.

But there is unique option **Files** for this product type. Have a look over that option.

### Files
There are three options here to set before further action.

#### Product Files
First there is a button to select the downloadable files to set for the customer to view. When clicked, it will direct to a popup window in which the display name and the path of the downloadable file are set.

#### Download limit
This determines the maximum number of copies allowed to be downloaded by a single customer. Enter a numeric value to set the limit.

#### Download Expires(in days)
This will set a deadline for the product link to be active to download the product. If the deadline set to be 15 days, for instance, the link goes inactive on the start of 16th day.

All other options are same as simple product.
