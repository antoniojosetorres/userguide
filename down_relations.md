# Relations

Relations are used to promote sales by suggesting the customer with higher value options and additional options to be bought with a particular product.

* In this tab page, relations are set for Upsells and Cross sells
* An ***upsell*** is to get the customer to spend more money – buy a more expensive model of the same type of product, or add features / warranties that relate to the product in question.
* A ***cross-sell*** is to get the customer to spend more money buy adding more products from other categories than the product being viewed or purchased.
* **Example**:
    The terms cross-sell and upsell are often used interchangeably because, let’s face it, this gets confusing. Say the customer is viewing a joomla basic extension for $45.

You can suggest the customer with some options, so that the customer may be convinced to buy one of your options, thus promoting a higher sale for you.

   * joomla standard extension -> $55 - Upsell, same product family, more expensive
   * joomla Professional extension -> $95  - Upsell, same product family, more expensive
   * plugins -> $15 - Cross sell, related product, additional sell
