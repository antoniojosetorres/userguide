# Tax

This tab deals with all activities that are related to tax.

* Prices Entered with tax

    This is a very important option which deserves careful attention when entering the price of a product. The two options are:
    1. Yes, I will enter prices inclusive of tax
    2. No, I will enter prices exclusive of tax
The price entered initially will be the one till the end. Later alterations will not reflect in the product price.

* Calculate Tax based on

    Three options available. Based on the option selected, tax will be calculated since the tax may vary depending upon the address.
    1. Billing Address
    2. Shipping Address
    3. Store Address
    
* Default Customer Address

    Customer's address should be selected automatically from the available options in the list, before the customer inputs his/her own.
    
* Price Display Options

Price of a product can be displayed in three formats.
    1. Only the price of the product.
    2. Price inclusive of relevant tax, as a single figure.
    3. Price and Tax separately.
One of these options can be selected here.

* Apply Discounts

    Since discounts are usually applied before calculating the tax, the default selection of this option is 'Before Tax', but if it is desired to be applied after tax calculation, then select option 'After Tax'.
