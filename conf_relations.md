# Relations

![Configurable Relations](product_conf_relations.png)

* In this tab page, relations are set for Upsells and Cross sells
* An ***upsell*** is to get the customer to spend more money – buy a more expensive model of the same type of product, or add features / warranties that relate to the product in question.
* A ***cross-sell*** is to get the customer to spend more money buy adding more products from other categories than the product being viewed or purchased.
* **Example**:
    The terms cross-sell and upsell are often used interchangeably because, let’s face it, this gets confusing. Say the customer is viewing a plain veg pizza for $5.

You can suggest the customer with some options, so that the customer may be convinced to buy one of your options, thus promoting a higher sale for you.

   * Veg Pizza with capsicum -> $8 - Upsell, same product family, more expensive
   * Veg Pizza with paneer butter -> $10  - Upsell, same product family, more expensive
   * Beverages/Ice cream -> $3 - Cross sell, related product, additional sell
