This, as everyone knows, paying at the time of purchase, in cash. This can be either at the product outlet or at customer's home or office, where the delivery is made.

* ***Money Order***

A money order is a payment order for a pre-specified amount of money. As it is required that the funds be prepaid for the amount shown on it, it is a more trusted method of payment than a cheque.
