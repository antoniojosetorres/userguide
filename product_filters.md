# Product Filters

These are used to narrow out the search for a particular product.

In this page, first Fiter Groups are created and in each group some Filter Names will be added, and based on the Filter Name, products will be searched.

* E.g., Filter Group : Clothing
    * Filter Names
        * Mens
        * Womens
        * Kids

This is illustrated in the image below:
