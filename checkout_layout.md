# Checkout Layout

In this tab, the checkout layout can be set.

* ***Checkout Billing Address Layout***

    This option helps to include/exclude the required fields in the layout of Billing Address. For e.g.,
    <div class="row-fluid">
		<div class="span6">[first_name] [last_name] [phone_1] [phone_2] [company] [tax_number]</div>
		<div class="span6">[address_1] [address_2] [city] [zip] [country_id] [zone_id]</div>
		</div>
    Like this any html code can be added here for one's desired layout.
