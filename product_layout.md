First you need to enter the title of the item you create. For example, it is entered with **Apparel**. The alias will be automatically generated based on the title.

Then, you have several tabs in this page. Let us see one by one. First is the **Details** tab.

Here, you choose the **Menu Item Type** by clicking on the 'Select' button. You will get a pop-up window like this:

This tab has the common settings for all items. If you want to show images for product options or if you want to add some custom CSS code, you can do that here. Otherwise, you can leave them as they are.

Next tab is 'Item View options in category listings'. Check the image below:

![View_category_listing](product_layout_view_category_1.png)

In this tab, you are setting the configuration for how to display the product in the cart and the features and options to display with the product.

You can display any number of products as you like in the shop. Enter the no of products to be displayed in the text box provided and the number of columns in which the product display is divided.
As the no of products increases, the image display size will be decreased. 

Also, select all other options as per your choice. Refer the next image.
