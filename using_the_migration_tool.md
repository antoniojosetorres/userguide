# Using the migration tool

### 1. Installation

You can use the standard Joomla installer for installing the tool.

Login to Joomla administrator and go to Extension Manager
and install the tool

### 2. Backup! Backup! Backup!
Take a FULL BACKUP of your website using Akeeba Backup. 
If you proceed without taking a BACKUP, you will not be able to recover your data in case something went wrong.

The Tool will not allow you to proceed if you do not have the Akeeba Backup component installed. 
We had to force this check because some Joomla web masters do not have the habit of taking regular backup of their site.
