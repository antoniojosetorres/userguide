# Show J2Store content in Front-end

This section will help you understand how to display the SEBLOD article in front end.

The display can be achieved in the following methods:

* **Category Blog View**
* **Single Article View**

To display SEBLOD articles in the frontend, you need to create a menu exclusively and then you can display it. 

### Create a Menu Item
In the backend main menu, go to **Menus -> Main Menu**. You will get the **Main Menu Items** list, as shown in the image below:
