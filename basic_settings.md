# Basic Settings

>Some basic settings need to be done before you proceed. This will be handled by the following options.

 * Enable J2Store CSS
 
    Template style can be customized by adding the component's *j2store.css* file to the template's css folder. Enabling this option will search for the template's css folder for _j2store.css_ file. It will be included if it exists in the folder or else the component's default j2store.css file will be loaded.

* Load jQuery
*(Only for joomla 2.5)*
    
    If your template or your extensions load jQuery by default and you do not want jQuery to be loaded, then you can avoid it by choosing *NO* in this option. Otherwise, you can load jQuery either locally or from a remote area, for eg. google.com
    
* Load jQuery UI
    
    This option is same as the previous one. Here, there are four options available for selection. Either it can be avoided from loading, or it can be selected for frontend or backend or for both.

* Load Bootstrap
 *(Only for joomla 2.5)*

    If the template is loaded with bootstrap, and if the user does not want it to be loaded, the user may choose NO, otherwise choose YES to load the default Bootstrap CSS packed with j2store.

* Who can see 'add to cart'
 
    This is an option for the user to add his/her product of choice to the cart to proceed for billing. This can be set to be viewed by 'anyone' or for 'registered users only'.

* Date Format

    Here one can choose the display format of date from several [available options](http://php.net/manual/en/datetime.formats.date.php). 
    
* Folder path for digital goods

    The relative path to the folder with your corresponding files.
