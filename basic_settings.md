# Basic Settings

    >Some basic settings need to be done before you proceed. This will be handled by the following options.
 * Enable J2Store CSS
 
      >Template style can be customized by adding the component's *j2store.css* file to the template's css folder. Enabling this option will search for the template's css folder for _j2store.css_ file. It will be included if it exists in the folder or else the component's default j2store.css file will be loaded.

* Load jQuery

    >If your template or your extensions load jQuery by default and you do not want jQuery to be loaded, then you can avoid it by choosing *NO* in this option. Otherwise, you can load jQuery either locally or from a remote area, for eg. google.com
    
* Load jQuery UI
    
    >This option is same as the previous one. Here, there are four options available for selection. Either it can be avoided from loading, or it can be selected for frontend or backend or both.
