# Basic Settings

    Some basic settings need to be done before you proceed. This will be handled by the following options.
 * Enable J2Store CSS
 
       Template style can be customized by adding the component's j2store.css file to the template's css folder. Enabling this option will search for the template's css folder for _j2store.css_ file. It will be loaded if it exists in the folder or else the component's default j2store.css file will be loaded.
