# Migrating from old 2.x versions to 3.x



### Migration tool
We have created a simple migration tool that will help you migrate your 2.x store data to J2Store 3.x 
You can download the migration tool at our website or directly from the following url:

### Actions to be taken before migration

Please install Akeeba Backup, which is one of the best backup apps available for Joomla (and it is free! ) and take a **FULL BACKUP** of your site.

### Warning
If you proceed without taking a BACKUP and if you wanted to revert back to old version, you will end up going in the toughest route. So please take a FULL BACKUP of your site before proceeding with the migration

- Set your site offline
