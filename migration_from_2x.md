# Migrating from old 2.8.x versions to 3.x

We have created a tool for migrating your 2.x store to the latest 3.x store.
Please read the documentation carefully before you attempt the migration.

### Actions to be taken before migration

Please install Akeeba Backup, which is one of the best backup apps available for Joomla (and it is free! ) and take a **FULL BACKUP** of your site.

### Warning
If you proceed without taking a BACKUP and if you wanted to revert back to old version, you will end up going in the toughest route. So please take a FULL BACKUP of your site before proceeding with the migration
