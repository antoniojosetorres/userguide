# Migrating from old 2.x versions to 3.x

### Pre-requists
1. Joomla 3.3.x 
2. J2Store 2.8.0 or later

You can use the migration tool only when your Joomla version is 3.3 or later.
If you are currently running the store in Joomla 2.5, please consider upgrading your website to latest Joomla version because the Joomla 2.5 life has ended in December 2014 itself.

### Migration tool
We have created a simple migration tool that will help you migrate your 2.x store data to J2Store 3.x 
You can download the migration tool at our website or directly from the following url:

### Actions to be taken before migration

Please install Akeeba Backup, which is one of the best backup apps available for Joomla (and it is free! ) and take a **FULL BACKUP** of your site.
