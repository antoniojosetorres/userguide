# Troubleshoot product display module issues

#### Why product description not showing when viewing product using J2Store Product Display Module ?

**Reason :** You have not chosen J2Store > Product list view menu in module settings.

If you have not selected a product list menu in the Product display module, then while visiting the detail page, the system wont know where to inherit the display parameters from.

Please check the product module settings and make sure you have selected a product list menu there.
Then in the respective menu, make sure that the product descriptions are set to show in the Item view options tab.

#### Are you getting the error when you click to view product
