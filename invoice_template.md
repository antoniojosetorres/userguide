# Invoice Template

This is a default layout or design for how an invoice should be looking. There are many details in the invoice that need to be carefully arranged in order to understand the invoice clearly both by the customer and the seller.

The following points reveal the process of an invoice template.

#### Title
The title of the template. You can have as many templates as you like and hence it necessary to give a unique title to each and every template.
#### Order Status
Invoice will be generated based on the order status only. To generate an invoice, the orderstatus should be **'COMPLETED'**.
#### Language
Here you can select for which particular language this template can be used or for all the languages.
#### Groups
This states that which group can generate an invoice for e.g., groups like Administrator, Manager, Editor etc. can be able to generate invoices whereas public and guest user groups can not do so. This can be determined using this field.
#### Payment Methods
This defines the payment methods that are accepted for selling. Some payment options may not be accepted by some sellers and they may wish to avoid those options. For that it has been enabled to select the options from the available list.
