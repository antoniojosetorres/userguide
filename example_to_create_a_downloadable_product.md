# Example to Create a Downloadable Product

**J2Store** implements an innovative concept in creating products. It uses the Joomla articles as products. So to create a product is to create an article.

So, lets create an article.

### Creating an Article

A downloadable product is one that has no physical existence. It can be downloaded as per the terms and conditions of the seller. It can be a book, a video, a music album or even a software extension like joomla extension. To create a downloadable product, follow the steps:

* Enter the name for your product. 
* Since you are creating article, you need to tell that the article be treated as product. So, select 'Yes'. 
* Select the type of the product, i.e., 'Downloadable'.
* Now, click the 'Save and Continue' button.

Your product is successfully created and a message will be displayed like this.

In the above image, you can set a date range for the special price, otherwise, you can leave it empty for the special price to be applied always. For example, if a customer buys 2 or more copies of the E-Book, you can offer a discount in price, throughout the year. Now, you have entered the values, and click the blue 'Create' button and you will get the special price listed below, as shown in the image.
