* ***Show Base/Regular Price***

    If advanced pricing option is used, i.e., a discount is offered on base price, it can be displayed using this option by setting it to **'Yes'**. It will show the base price in **~~strikedout~~** format.
    
Example:
In J2Store we can set the base price for the product and we can also offer some discount on base price. This discount on baseprice is called advanced price. If this option is **Enabled**(set to 'Yes'), it will show the base price in strikedout format and display the advanced price. Lets assume that the base price of a product is $ 300.00 and it is offered a discount of $ 50.00, then the new price will be $ 250.00

It will be displayed as below:

Base Price : ~~300.00~~

Advanced Price : 250.00

    If this option is set to **'Show'**, a modifier '**+/-**' will be shown in the view, to modify the product price.
