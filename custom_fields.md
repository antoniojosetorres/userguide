# Custom Fields

These are created for additional details to be used for shipment like processes. For instance, 'last name' of a customer is not required for billing but it may need for shipment. So, it is created as a custom field and made to be displayed in shipping address.

Some of the examples for the custom fields are:

* first_name
* last_name
* address_1
* address_2
* phone_1
* phone_2
* city
* zip
* company
* email
* zone_id
* country_id
