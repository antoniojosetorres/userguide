# Custom Fields

These are created for additional details to be used in checkout processes that involves billing, payment, shipping etc. For instance, 'last name' of a customer is not required for billing but it is required for shipment. So, it is created as a custom field and made to be displayed in shipping address.

There are two types of custom fields, namely, **Core custome fields** and **Non-Core custom fields**.

Custom fields that are in J2Store by default are **Core** custom fields and that are created by users are **Non-Core** custom fields.

Core custom fields can be edited as per users wish but it is not advisable to make changes to **Core** custom fields except changing the name and label of the fields.

The following is a list of **Core** custom fields:

* first_name
* last_name
* address_1
* address_2
* phone_1
* phone_2
* city
* zip
* country
* company
* email
* tax number
* zone_id
* country_id

Apart from these core custom fields, you can create your own custom fields according to your requirements.

For example, if you want to add a custom note for your reference, you can create it as a custom field and make it to be displayed in the billing or shipping process.
