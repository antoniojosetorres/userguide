# Discount

#### *This is a J2Store PRO exclusive feature*

This is for discounts that are offered to customers.

* ***Enable Coupons***

    By default this option is set to **No**. If the product has some discounts based on the coupons, then set this option to **Yes**.
    
* ***Enable Gift Vouchers***

    By enabling this option with a '**Yes**', the customers can be offered gift vouchers with fixed value, say **$ 25.00**, which in turn, can be applied during the checkout.
