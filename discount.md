#### *This is a J2Store PRO exclusive feature*

This is for discounts that are offered to customers.

* ***Enable Coupons***

    If discount is offered based on coupons, this option can be set to **Yes**. Otherwise, leave it to **No**.

    By enabling this option with a '**Yes**', the customers can be offered gift vouchers with fixed value, say **$ 25.00**, which in turn, can be applied during the checkout.
