# Relations

![Simple Product Relations](product_simple_relations.png)


* In this tab page, relations are set for Upsells and Cross sells
* An ***upsell*** is to get the customer to spend more money – buy a more expensive model of the same type of product, or add features / warranties that relate to the product in question.
* A ***cross-sell*** is to get the customer to spend more money buy adding more products from other categories than the product being viewed or purchased.
* **Example**:
    The terms cross-sell and upsell are often used interchangeably because, let’s face it, this gets confusing. Say the customer is viewing a Laptop with 2GB/500GB for $500.

You can suggest the customer with these options, so that the customer may be convinced to buy one of your options, thus promoting a higher sale for you.

   * 4GB/500GB-> $550 - Upsell, same product family, more expensive
   * 4GB/1TB -> $700  - Upsell, same product family, more expensive
   * Laptop Bag -> $25 - Cross sell, related product, additional sell
