# Variable Product

A variable product has some features varying from other items of the same product, for e.g., a T-Shirt is a variable product, by color, size, stock, price, etc. Each variation can have different properties and prices.

### Create a variable product
There are several tabs in which the details of the product have to be given under various classifications as explained below.

#### General
* First select whether the product is to be displayed in front of the store
* Select the brand or manufacturer of the product from the available list
* Select the vendor from whom the product is available for purchase
* Specify whether the product is taxable and if it is, select the taxprofile relevant to the product

#### Images
* Select the main and thumbnail images for the products
* Add more images if necessary

#### Variants
* A variant defines how this product differs from other products of same type
* It may be SKU no, price, stock level or color
* It can be searched for and added

#### Filters
* Add any filters to narrow up the search for products

#### Relations
* In this tab page relations set for Upsells and Cross sells
* An ***upsell*** is to get the customer to spend more money – buy a more expensive model of the same type of product, or add features / warranties that relate to the product in question.
* A ***cross-sell*** is to get the customer to spend more money buy adding more products from other categories than the product being viewed or purchased.
* **Example**:
    The terms cross-sell and upsell are often used interchangeably because, let’s face it, this gets confusing. Say the customer is viewing a Laptop with 2GB/500GB for $500.

    * 4GB/500GB-> $550 - Upsell, same product family, more expensive
    * 4GB/1TB -> $700  - Upsell, same product family, more expensive
    * Laptop Bag -> $25 - Cross sell, related product, additional sell
