A configurable product is the one that can be configured by the customer who intends to purchase the product. A suitable example is, Pizza. This basic pizza is displayed as a configurable product, and the user is allowed to add toppings over the basic product. The price of the product will be changing according to the toppings added by the customer. Follow the steps to create a configurable product.

* Enter the name for your product. 
* Since you are creating article, you need to tell that the article be treated as product. So, select 'Yes'. 
* Select the type of the product, i.e., 'Configurable'.
* Now, click the 'Save and Continue' button.

Your product is successfully created and a message will be displayed like this.
