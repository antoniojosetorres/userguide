# Short Codes

### Additional short codes
In addition to the primary short code, you can also use the following additional codes inside {j2store}{/j2store} . Each code should be separated by a pipe (|) symbol.

**Example:**
    
    {j2store}10|upsells|crosssells{/j2store}
    
    {j2store}price|thumbnail|mainimage|mainadditional|upsells|crosssells{/j2store}
    

These additional short codes will work in all **Add to cart** placement modes. Please use these codes judiciously and wisely for better performance.
