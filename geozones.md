# Geozones

Geozones are created based on the needs of the legal process. Geographical locations that have the same legal proceedings can be listed in the same geozone. Geozones are used to set up different tax practices for different countries and zones.
* For instance, if tax percentage for Europe is set at 5% and for US at 10%, then two geozones are created for this purpose and countries belonging to Europe are added in one geozone and US to other geozone.

If a geozone is created and saved, then an option row will be displayed to add countries and zones to the new geozone. Like this any number of zones or countries can be added to geozone.
