#### Relations
* In this tab page relations set for Upsells and Cross sells
* An ***upsell*** is to get the customer to spend more money – buy a more expensive model of the same type of product, or add features / warranties that relate to the product in question.
* A cross-sell is to get the customer to spend more money buy adding more products from other categories than the product being viewed or purchased.
* Example:
    The terms cross-sell and upsell are often used interchangeably because, let’s face it, this gets confusing. Say the customer is viewing a Laptop with 2GB/500GB for $500.

    * 4GB/500GB-> $550 - Upsell, same product family, more expensive
    * 4GB/1TB -> $700  - Upsell, same product family, more expensive
    * Laptop Bag -> $25 - Cross sell, related product, additional sell
